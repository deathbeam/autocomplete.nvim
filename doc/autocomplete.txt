1. autocomplete.nvim                          *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim*

Very simple and minimal autocompletion for cmdline and buffer using LSP and
Tree-sitter with signature help.

Originally I made this just for my dotfiles as I did not needed most of stuff
existing plugins provided I had some issues with the ones that were close to
what I wanted so as a learning exercise I decided to try and implement it by
myself. Then I just extracted the code to separate plugin in case anyone else
wanted to use it too. Just a warning, there might be some bugs and as this
requires Neovim 0.10+ (e.g nightly), that one can also have bugs by itself.

REQUIREMENTS                     *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-requirements*

Requires **Neovim Nighly/development** version. This version supports stuff
like popup menu for completion menu and closing windows properly from cmdline
callbacks.

For installation instructions/repository go here
<https://github.com/neovim/neovim>

If you want to use Tree-sitter autocompletion (as fallback when you dont have
LSP server running) you also need to have nvim-treesitter plugin
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>


INSTALLATION                     *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-installation*

Just use lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim> or |packages| with git
submodules or something else I don’t care. Read the documentation of whatever
you want to use.


USAGE                                   *autocomplete-autocomplete.nvim-usage*

Just require either buffer or cmd module or both and call setup on them.
**NOTE**: You dont need to provide the configuration, below is just default
config, you can just call setup with no arguments for default.

>lua
    -- LSP signature help
    require("autocomplete.signature").setup {
        border = nil, -- Signature help border style
        width = 80, -- Max width of signature window
        height = 25, -- Max height of signature window
        debounce_delay = 100
    }
    
    -- buffer autocompletion with LSP and Tree-sitter
    require("autocomplete.buffer").setup {
        entry_mapper = nil, -- Custom completion entry mapper
        debounce_delay = 100
    }
    
    -- cmdline autocompletion
    require("autocomplete.cmd").setup {
        mappings = {
            accept = '<C-y>',
            reject = '<C-e>',
            complete = '<C-space>',
            next = '<C-n>',
            previous = '<C-p>',
        },
        border = nil, -- Cmdline completion border style
        columns = 5, -- Number of columns per row
        rows = 0.3, -- Number of rows, if < 1 then its fraction of total vim lines, if > 1 then its absolute number
        close_on_done = true, -- Close completion window when done (accept/reject)
        debounce_delay = 100,
    }
<

You also probably want to enable `popup` in completeopt to show documentation
preview:

>lua
    vim.o.completeopt = 'menuone,noinsert,popup'
<

And you also ideally want to set the capabilities so Neovim will fetch
documentation and additional text edits when resolving completion items:

>lua
    -- Here we grab default Neovim capabilities and extend them with ones we want on top
    local capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', 
        vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities(), 
        require('autocomplete.capabilities'))
    
    -- Now set capabilities on your LSP servers
    require('lspconfig')['<YOUR_LSP_SERVER>'].setup {
        capabilities = capabilities
    }
<

If you want to disable `<CR>` to accept completion (as with autocomplete its
very annoying) you can do this:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("i", "<CR>", function()
        return vim.fn.pumvisible() ~= 0 and "<C-e><CR>" or "<CR>"
    end, { expr = true, replace_keycodes = true })
<
